# Cryptop 🔐

**Cryptop** is a modern terminal-based password manager, specially designed for users looking to migrate from the discontinued Dropbox Passwords service.

## Why Cryptop?

Dropbox discontinued its password management service, leaving many users with exported CSV files containing all their passwords in **plain text**. This is a serious security risk - anyone who gains access to your computer or backups could read all your passwords without any barrier.

**Keeping an unencrypted CSV file with your passwords is extremely dangerous.** That's why I created Cryptop: to provide a simple way to encrypt and manage those exported passwords locally.

Cryptop allows you to:

- ✅ **Easily import** your exported Dropbox passwords (CSV format)
- ✅ **Strong encryption** using AES-256 to protect your data
- ✅ **Intuitive terminal interface** with keyboard navigation
- ✅ **Completely offline** - your passwords stay on your machine
- ✅ **Local encrypted database** secured with your master password

## Features

- 🔍 **Fast search** with real-time filtering
- 📝 **Full editor** to create, edit and organize your passwords
- 🎨 **Modern interface** with dark theme and custom colors
- ⌨️ **Keyboard shortcuts** for efficient navigation
- 💾 **Automatic encrypted saving**

## Installation

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g cryptop
```

## Usage

### Import CSV from Dropbox

If you have a CSV file exported from Dropbox Passwords:

```bash
cryptop exported_dropbox_accounts.csv
```

The program will ask for a **master password** that will be used to encrypt all your data. **Remember this password!** - without it you won't be able to access your accounts.

The CSV should have the following columns:
- `title` - Account title
- `website` - Website URL
- `login` - Username or email
- `password` - Password
- `otpSecret` - (Optional) Secret for OTP/2FA codes
- `notes` - (Optional) Additional notes

### Launch the Interface

To open the password manager:

```bash
cryptop
```

Enter your master password to unlock the encrypted database.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### General Navigation
- `/` - Open search
- `ESC` - Clear search / Close confirmation dialogs
- `n` - Create new account
- `d` - Delete selected account (with confirmation)
- `Enter` - Edit selected account
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Navigate between fields
- `↑` / `↓` - Navigate the list
- `Ctrl+C` / `q` - Quit

### In the Editor
- `Enter` - Go to next field
- `ESC` - Cancel editing
- `Tab` - Next field
- "Save" button - Save changes
- "Cancel" button - Discard changes
- "Delete" button - Delete current account (with confirmation)

## Security

- 🔒 **AES-256 encryption**: Your passwords are encrypted with your master password
- 🚫 **No cloud storage**: Everything is saved locally in `~/.cryptop/db.json`
- 🔑 **Single master password**: You only need to remember one password
- 💻 **No internet connection**: Doesn't send data to any server

### ⚠️ Important

1. **Never lose your master password** - there's no way to recover your data without it
2. Make **regular backups** of the `~/.cryptop/db.json` file
3. The database is stored in your home directory at `~/.cryptop/db.json`
4. Use a **strong password** as your master password

### 🛡️ Security Disclaimer

This tool was created with the best intentions to help users protect their exported passwords. However, **I am not a security expert**. While I've implemented industry-standard AES-256 encryption and followed security best practices to the best of my knowledge, I cannot guarantee that this software is free from vulnerabilities.

**Use at your own risk.** I am not responsible for any data loss, security breaches, or other issues that may arise from using this software. If you have extremely sensitive data or require enterprise-level security guarantees, please consider using professionally audited password management solutions.

That said, using Cryptop is **significantly safer than keeping your passwords in a plain text CSV file**.

**Note**: This project is not affiliated with Dropbox Inc. It is an independent tool created to help users manage their passwords locally after the discontinuation of the Dropbox Passwords service.
